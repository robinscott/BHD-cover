And when the faces break they poison me and all I said
Now its a different game you see my cos mind is wanting more than me
Life affirmation tastes so cold
In my head I fly, in my head I soar
It won't leave me be, I want tomorrow to be next week
Cut a story from my chest, beat my memories from my breast
Nothing taught, nothing learnt, better than this, better burned
I am here, or are you insane?
I don't discriminate, I just emasculate
In the palm of my hand so simply
Every breath is a gift you see
