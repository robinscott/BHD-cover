## Sample lyrics
> And when the faces break they poison me and all I said

> Now its a different game you see my cos mind is wanting more than me

> Life affirmation tastes so cold

> In my head I fly, in my head I soar

> It won't leave me be, I want tomorrow to be next week

> Cut a story from my chest, beat my memories from my breast

> Nothing taught, nothing learnt, better than this, better burned

> I am here, or are you insane?

> I don't discriminate, I just emasculate

> In the palm of my hand so simply

> Every breath is a gift you see
